# Set

A set is pretty simple. You'll also hear them called collections depending which language you're working with. A set allows allows at least four things:
1. add
2. remove
3. contains
4. toList
The basic idea is that you can add items to a set and then later check if they're there. You can also request later a list of those items in the set (though with *no guaranteed order; sets have no notion of order.*) They're also useful for deduplication since *you can only add something to a set once.*
